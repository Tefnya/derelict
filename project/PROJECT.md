# Derelict

This mod focuses on things that are inaccessible, forgotten and taken over by nature.  
It also helps create such builds, with the carefully crafted selection of blocks and tools.

Currently, it only adds decorative blocks and the Waxing Staff and Aging Staff. This is only the beginning :)

# Configuration

Two config files: `derelict.json5` and `derelict-client.json5` are provided.  
Every option is explained inside the config files, above the corresponding fields.  
You can tweak:
- The behavior of flickering lights (prioritized for either performance, looks or a custom resource pack)
- The appearance of the waxed block indicator (or disable it)
- The in-world and in-gui tips when holding a Honeycomb, Waxing Staff or Aging Staff

# Future plans

- custom abandoned biomes and structures
- many challenging mobs and bosses
- tons of new building blocks
- more tools, weapons and other fun items
- possibly a built-in Resource Pack for arachnophobes :)

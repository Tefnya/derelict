A tiny spider that has a 10% chance (configurable) to spawn from a dying Spider or Cave Spider. They:

- Can be collected into a bucket, and placed on the ground, or hanging from a ceiling as a decoration,
- When hanging as a decoration, will not despawn and will be immune to damage

Completely overhauled tiny spider particles to make them even more crawly and creepy!

- Waxing blocks with the Waxing Staff
- Aging blocks with the Aging Staff

## Technical

- Derelict now uses my library, [Gimm1q](https://github.com/mim1q/gimm1q)
- Changed a few block and item IDs, so if you used these, they might be missing from your world after updating
- Updated the license. Source code is still under MIT, but assets such as textures, models etc. are now All Rights Reserved
